The RoboCup competition uses a computer referee to communicate with the robot
players. The computer referee runs the 'Game Controller' that sends out state
information about the game: penalties, scores, etc. This directory contains a
copy of the latest version of the game controller for convience. We make no
gaurentee that these are the latest version of the Game Controllers provided by
the RoboCup organization. They are the latest version that has been tested with
our code.
